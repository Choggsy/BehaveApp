# Submission to the ConnectHack : Innovating Across Borders Hackathon.

This App has been developed over the course of 2 days to
solve the problem of the brief on improving interface and usability of Travel Apps.
Our team is called Syn tax, and we have focused on improving features that explore specific
country culture and safety. The Team consisted of five members with a mixed range of skills from
different degrees and levels. I Will be the main contributor to this implementation but
all the requirements and interface were created as a group effort in our PBR over a couple hours.

### First Day End Product 
This is the Apps design and functionality after day one. The core layout of the app has been established
and I’ve started the implementation of some of the features.

#### Here you can see the following:
- The Recycle view has been populated with the data from a JSON file in the Main/Assets. This is where
we will store the behavioural information, but as a first draft to indicate a connection has been made 
I’ve populated the file with some dummy data.

- The Information Cards have been implemented into a scrolling carousal on the middle of the screen. They currently have
no behaviour. Tomorrow I will make the images image buttons which open a new view with the info-card information.

- The Country selection bar has been added, which allows users to enter text into each field. This will 
have behaviour added tomorrow to filter the information cards to a matching Country parameter.

- Buttons have been added to the static bottom bar of the app- they currently don't link to any additional
pages. For the purpose of this Hackathon being two days of coding I doubt I’ll get any further than this 
page for my implementation. But in the interest of finishing this project later those icons 
are buttons. They currently have no behaviour.

### Second Day End Product 
This is the Apps design and functionality after day two. The layout has been improved to use Image buttons now and display in a grid layout. The Logo changes as the Interface for the app was developed in parrell to this apps development.
