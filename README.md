# Submission to the ConnectHack : Innovating Across Borders Hackathon.

This App has been developed over the course of 2 days to
solve the problem of the brief on improving interface and usability of Travel Apps.
Our team is called Syn tax and we have focused on improving features that explore specific
country culture and safety. The Team consisted of five members with a mixed range of skills from
different degrees and levels. I Will be the main contributor to this implementation but
all the requirements and interface where created as a group effort in our PBR over a couple hours.
